Welcome to Blocklister
----------------------

Blocklister generates MikroTik Router OS compatible address-lists from commonly
known Internet Blocklists such as iblocklist (https://www.iblocklist.com) and
DShield (http://feeds.dshield.org/block.txt). The lists are updated once every
3 days. The following lists are available:

{% for list in lists %}
    * {{ list|attr("__name__") }} - https://blocklister.gefoo.org/{{ list|attr("__name__")|lower }}
{%- endfor %}

The resulting script will first remove all ip addresses matching a specific
comment by default the name of the list and later add the entire list again.
The addresslist name and comment can be customized by query parameters which
are explained in the following paragraph.

Please note that each ip is limited to 50 requests per day.

Query Parameters
-----------------

With these query parameters you can customized the name and comment which will
be used to create the address-list on your router.

listname           The name of the resulting addresslist
comment            Use this query parameter to adjust the comment which will be
                   used for this addresslist (Please make sure that this comment
                   is unique among your addresslists)


Example with curl
-----------------

curl https://blocklister.gefoo.org/ads?listname=Blocklist?comment=ads


Example with RouterOS
---------------------

To use this service automatically you can add the following script on your
router. Of course you will need to create a scheduler to execute this script
automatically.


/system script \
  add name="Blocklister_download_Ads" source="\
  /tool fetch url=\"https://blocklister.gefoo.org/ads\" dst-path=\"ads.rsc\";\
  /import file-name=\"ads.rsc\";"
